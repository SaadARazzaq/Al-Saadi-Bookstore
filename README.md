# Al Saadi Bookstore

## Description
Al Saadi Bookstore is a web-based bookstore application developed using ASP.NET MVC, ADO.NET, and Entity Framework. It follows a Database First approach and utilizes Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2019 (SSMS) and MySQL as the database query language. Visual Studio 2019 is used to manage the backend of the web application. The application consists of three modules: admin, user, and books.

The admin module allows administrators to perform various tasks such as adding, deleting, updating, and viewing books. The user module is designed for registered users who can browse and purchase books by adding them to their cart. The books module handles the creation and management of book properties. All three modules are synchronized with each other.
